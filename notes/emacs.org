I would like to store the process how I configure the emacs. I like Mr. Steve Purcell's emacs configuration. It's just awesome. It's easier to start with his as I am a newbie or I will never start learning Lisp. :-(

# Go to your home directory

$ git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git

# Then rename it

$ mv emacs.d .emacs.d

# Open Emacs. It will automatically download the required packages from the Elpa. Then from Emacs, install the Evil mode. I know ... Yes. It's Vi.. But it's good.

M-x package-install RET evil RET

# Then you have to write to some configuration file

$ cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp
$ vi init-evil.el

;;; Enable TAB to cycle through orgmode Headers
(setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil)

;;; Enable Evil Mode
(require 'evil)
(evil-mode 1)

(provide 'init-evil)
;;; END

# Then open a new file init-local.el

$ cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp
$ vi init-local.el

;;; Visual Line Mode: To wrap long lines
(global-visual-line-mode t)

;;; Evil Mode enabled
(require 'init-evil nil t)

(provide 'init-local)
;;; END

# Done

That's it for the time being. I hope you like it!
